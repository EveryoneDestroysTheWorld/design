A primary currency called “Dreamstone” will be used to purchase cosmetic items or server-wide boosts. 

Currency should not be used to give a specific player or team an unfair advantage. All purchasable items should either be cosmetic items that do not affect gameplay, or they should be boosts that give all players an equal chance of getting a boost.

Beastslash staff can adjust a player’s balance as necessary.

## Receiving currency
Players can receive Dreamstone in a variety of ways:
* If a player wins a game, they will receive [x] Dreamstone.
* If a player participates in a game, they will receive [x] Dreamstone.
* Players can also purchase Dreamstone directly for themselves or other players by using Robux.

## Currency multiplier
Players can receive a “multiplier” on awarded Dreamstone by having a boost active, having a win streak, or owning a specific game pass. 

The win streak multiplier is as follows: CA = CW * [0.95 + (0.05 * W)]

CA = Dreamstone awarded, CW = Dreamstone won, W = number of wins
