## Effect
When using the item, you drink it for 3 seconds to receive the effect, but it can be cancelled when needed. If successful, the speed of all of the movements, such as running, attacking and reloading, is doubled for 10 seconds. After drinking it, the item will take 30 seconds to reload. It can sometimes be dropped from downed players or always if they're holding it. However, drinking Inner-gy Dragon while the effect is already active could down you.
