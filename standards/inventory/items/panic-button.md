## Effect
To get this item working, use it to prepare for 4 seconds before pressing the button, but the process can be cancelled. If the button has been successfully pressed, you spawn right back to your team's spawn area. Additionally, you also receive your health fully regenerated. However, the cooldown will last for 60 seconds.
