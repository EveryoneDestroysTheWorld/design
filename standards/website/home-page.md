## Purpose
The purpose of the home page is to let the user know what the game is about and how to access it.

## Contents
### Trailer
At the top, there will be an entertaining trailer video featuring the core mechanics of the game.

### About
In this section, there are the following paragraphs:

> **Everyone Destroys the World**<br />
> The power's in your hands to destroy the world.

> **Demolish everything**<br />
> Everyone gets powerful abilities and weapons to bring it *allllll* down. It's very soothing to the soul.

> **Do it right**<br />
> Restore enemies' work. If you want it done right, you gotta destroy it yourself. They may come back for you, so be ready.

> **Build and publish stages**<br />
> You gotta start somewhere. Share them with friends and destroy it all, together ðŸ’–

> **Play together or go it alone**<br />
> You can make a demolition crew, or you can stay singleplayer. Vicious bots are here to keep you company.

### Progress 
Before the release, there are progress bars at the beginning and end of the website. The bars represent how close Beastslash is to releasing the game. There should be buttons that direct to the [progress page](./progress-page.md) 

### Play button
Soon after the release, near the top and the end of the page, there are play buttons. These buttons lead to Everyone Destroys the World's game page on the Roblox website. -->
