## Personality
### Organization
The host is very organized; he likes to know where everyone and everything is at all times. 

### Improvisation
Entro loves to improvise; his love makes him spontaneous at times. If he comes up with an idea for the game, he's going to do it â€” consequences or not. If it blows up in his face, then he won't do it again. Or, he'll try to do it again but in a "new and improved" way. 

### Playfulness
Sometimes, he lets players break the rules in the name of fun. The only rule that he follows to the tee is the time limit. He went as far as throwing a brick at a player for still playing after the timer went off.

## Relationships
### Argnorac
With Argnorac being Entro's boss, he tries to make sure that the game is in good condition every time she visits. Not to impress Argnorac, but more to ensure that she doesn't punish the Demonic Guard and the operating team. If Entro wants to change something that the boss disagrees with, Argnorac challenges him to duels. Entro, confident in his work, usually accepts, even though he knows the risk. 

### Announcer
The Announcer is Entro's assistant and best friend. They know all the ins-and-outs of the Arena, so Entro relies on the announcer a lot. -->
