## Layout
In the middle of the set, there's a wooden desk with an office chair behind it. Next to the desk is a fabric seat and some home decor. Beyond that, there's everything that you'd probably find on a talk show studio (cameras, lighting, teleprompter, etc.). There is also a place for a musical band to play their instruments, in addition to ladders and stairs for players to get to higher ground. 

Players will spawn across the set, but teams will spawn together. -->
