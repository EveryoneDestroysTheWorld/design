<!-- # Economy
Currency should not be used to give a specific player or team an unfair advantage. All purchasable items should either be cosmetic items that do not affect gameplay, or they should be boosts that give all players an equal chance of getting a boost.

Beastslash staff can adjust a playerâ€™s balance as necessary.

## Dreamstone
Dreamstone is the primary currency used to purchase cosmetic items or server-wide boosts. 

### Obtaining Dreamstone
Players can get Dreamstone through [match rewards](/matches/rewards.md). Dreamstone *should not* be purchasable.

### Currency multiplier
Players can receive a multiplier on awarded Dreamstone by having a boost active, having a win streak, or owning a specific game pass. 

The win streak multiplier is as follows: C<sub>A</sub> = C<sub>W</sub> * [0.95 + (0.05 * W)]

C<sub>A</sub> = Dreamstone total, C<sub>W</sub> = Dreamstone won, W = number of wins

## Beastslash Points
Beastslash Points (BP) are a secondary currency that is similar to Dreamstone, except that the currency is synchronized through all Beastslash games.

### Obtaining Beastslash Points
Players can receive Beastslash Points by purchasing it directly with Robux or receiving it as a gift from somebody.  -->
