# Turf War
**Turf War** is a game mode where the player or team that destroys the most wins the game. 

The game mode was introduced in v0.1.0.

## Dashing
If a contestant has a specific amount of stamina, they can dash in a direction by pressing a movement button (left, right, up, or down) twice. The contestant will quickly move in a specific direction; however, this will somewhat reduce the contestant's current stamina.

## User interface
### Results screen
The results screen will be shown at the end of the match. It will show which teams won and lost, the final destruction distribution, and player stats. Player stats include the following: 
* Banner
* Icon
* Display name
* Username
* Knockouts
* Wipeouts
* Assists
* Parts broken
* Parts repaired
* Archetype

From this screen, the player can ask for a rematch with the same participants or return to the lobby. Players who approve rematch requests will be queued together in a new match, while the players who refuse the request will stay behind.
