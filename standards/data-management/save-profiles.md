# Save profiles
There is only one save profile available for a player to use. If there is a save available when the player joins, it will be automatically loaded during the initial loading screen. 

<!-- ## Deleting save profiles
If the player would like to start over, they may do so by going to the title screen, opening the settings, then going through a prompt that discourages them from doing so. If the player still chooses to delete their data, then it will be immediately deleted. Any created stages will also be deleted from the server. Players currently playing in deleted stages will still play in the deleted stages until the end of the round, but they will not be able to access the deleted stages again.

## Transferring save profiles
The player may transfer their data to another player for any reason. Here's the process:
1. The sending player goes to the player settings and presses the "Transfer profile" button.
2. The sending player enters the receiving player's username, confirms that they want to transfer their save to another player, then sends the request to the receiving player.
3. The receiving player accepts the request after confirming that they want to overwrite their data. 
4. The game overwrites the receiving player's data with the sending player's data. The sending player's original data will be erased.
5. The game will teleport both players and force them to rejoin the server. The transfer process is complete.

Each transfer should be logged to ensure that the player is playing fair. -->
