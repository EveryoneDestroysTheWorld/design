### ðŸŽ® Game designers
Each game designer has at least one specialty that they will focus on. Game designers can still contribute outside of their specialty, and proposed changes will be reviewed by all designers, regardless of their focus area. 

If a game designer would like to change their focus area, they may edit this file and submit a pull request.
