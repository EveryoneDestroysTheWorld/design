# Matchmaking
The player can **matchmake** with other players while they are in the lobby. They can customize the match to their liking and search for players with similar settings, or they can search based on the [round rules](./round-rules.md). 

## Forfeiting the match
The player can leave the match only if the rest of the team agrees to forfeit the match. 

### Punishments for leaving team behind
If the player leaves the match for any reason without submitting a successful request, they can be punished by their team.

* **Temporary match ban:** The player can't matchmake until a timer runs out.
* **Purgatory match:** The player can only matchup with others who left early.
* **Rewards tax:** The player can freely matchup, but half of their winnings will be taxed and given to the team members.
* **Nothing:** The team decides not to act on it, acquitting the player.
