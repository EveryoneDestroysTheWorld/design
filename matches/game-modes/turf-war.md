# Turf War
**Turf War** is a game mode where the player or team that destroys the most wins the game. Custom weapons allowed, but the player must find the materials required for them.

The game mode was introduced in v1.0.0.

## Tutorial
Prior to the player joining their first match, the Host will offer to show the player the ways of the Turf War game mode. In the tutorial, they'll go over the rules, the player's ability, and the player's items. At the end, the player will have the chance to play against the Host. This will be optional; the player may leave the tutorial at any time.
