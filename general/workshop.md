# Workshop
The Workshop is a place in the arena where players can modify their items and weapons for free. 

## Attachments
The available modifications will be based on the player's item attachments. Some attachments may increase some stats, while decreasing others. Attachments may also add new abilities to weapons, but also require a specific number of materials.
