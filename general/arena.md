# Arena
The Arena serves as the DemoDemons lobby. The building is the shape of a heptagon. In the center lies a baseplate where all matches will take place. The baseplate is above a giant, circular pit leading to who-knows-where. On the sides of the arena are rows of seats for spectators. There are a few screens above the stands that show player stats, round info, and server announcements. There's also a giant tower in the stands for the Host to spectate the round.

There are also indoor floors in the arena. On the first floor, it houses entrance doors, the information desk, the match registration area, the Workshop, and the Dreamstone Shop. Everything beyond the first floor is off-limits. It's not because there's nothing there right now; it's just that the elevator *and* stairs are out-of-service.

All players will spawn in front of the information desk. Players may exit the arena by leaving the game.
