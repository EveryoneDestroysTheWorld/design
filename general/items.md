Whenever a pellet hits a surface like a player or building, a small explosion is created about 1.5(?)-ish studs in size.</td>

      <td>LoveGiver-HT</td>
      <td>Aim on one of your teammates nearby and use the item to activate the healing effect on them for 5+ HP per second. If you and them are too far away from each other during the effect, it'll be deactivated. There's no cooldown, so this item can be used infinitely.</td>
      <td>Feeling in need of support for your teammates? This tool will sure make you a helpful medic!</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Panic Button</td>
      <td>To get this item working, use it to prepare for 4 seconds before pressing the button, but the process can be cancelled. If the button has been successfully pressed, you spawn right back to your team's spawn area. Additionally, you also receive your health fully regenerated. However, the cooldown will last for 60 seconds.</td>
      <td>No way out of the trouble you're dealing with? Smash that button and go all the way back to how you started! Use it wisely, though.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Inner-gy Dragon</td>
      <td>When using the item, you drink it for 3 seconds to receive the effect, but it can be cancelled when needed. If successful, the speed of all of the movements, such as running, attacking and reloading, is doubled for 10 seconds. After drinking it, the item will take 30 seconds to reload. It can sometimes be dropped from downed players or always if they're holding it. However, drinking Inner-gy Dragon while the effect is already active could down you.</td>
      <td>Release the dragon! All the movements you perform are twice as fast for a wild while... when you drink it, of course.</td>
