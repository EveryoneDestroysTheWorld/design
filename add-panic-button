Name
Panic Button

Description
No way out of the trouble you're dealing with? Smash that button and go all the way back to how you started! Use it wisely, though.

Function
To get this item working, use it to prepare for 4 seconds before pressing the button, but the process can be cancelled. If the button has been successfully pressed, you spawn right back to your team's spawn area. Additionally, you also receive your health fully regenerated. However, the cooldown will last for 60 minutes.

Availability
This item is available after collecting the certain badge.
