## Effect
This item has no effect.

## Usage
Depending on the player's stamina, the player can use different styles while the Super Hammer is equipped.

### Normal (Less than 50 stamina)
Press the primary action button to hit something with the hammer, making them take 20 damage per hit. Press and hold the primary action button for up to 1 second to charge the hammer, increasing the damage up to 1.5 times. The hammer will break on the third time.

### The 5-piece combo (50 stamina or more)
Press the primary action button three times. On the third time, hold it to charge a spin, then release to hit something two more times. Press one more time to immediately stop spinning and break the hammer on something in front of you; otherwise, you'll send the hammer flying â€” it will break on impact.

### Hyper hammer (100 stamina)
Press the primary action button once and the player will become invincible to most hostilities for 10 seconds and will automatically start smashing whatever is in front of the player. During this time, no other action or item can be used and the player's stamina will decrease rapidly. The round music will temporarily oause as the hammer plays special music. By the time that the item breaks, the player's stamina will be depleted and the round music will resume.

If the player falls into the void, this style will not protect them.
