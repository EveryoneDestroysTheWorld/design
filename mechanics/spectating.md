# Spectating
A player may spectate a round in their own server, or across public servers. Spectators will have the option to “cheer” for a player, giving them a +5 HP boost. This will have no effect on a player’s health if they already have 100% of their health.

Players will have the option to prevent spectators from outside of their own server. Players will not have the option to block same-server spectators because they can visibly see the player in the arena anyway.
