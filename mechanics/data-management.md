# Data management
There is only one save file available for a player to use. If there is a save available when the player joins, it will be automatically loaded during the initial loading screen. 

If the player would like to start over, they may do so by going to the title screen, opening the settings, then going through a prompt that discourages them from doing so. If the player still chooses to delete their data, then it will be immediately deleted. Any created stages will also be deleted from the server. Players currently playing in deleted stages will still play in the deleted stages until the end of the round, but they will not be able to access the deleted stages again.

The player may transfer their data to another player. The receiving player’s data will be deleted and replaced with the sending player’s data. After it is sent, the sending player’s data will be erased.
