## Custom stages
The community can create custom stages. Upon approval by a community jury or Beastslash staff, the custom stages will be added to the pool of stages so that players can play them. Players can rate and review stages.

When Roblox allows developers to publish audios to the Marketplace, we can let players choose custom songs for stages.
