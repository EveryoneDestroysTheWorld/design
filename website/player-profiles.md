# Player profiles
People can view **player profiles** from a page on the website. It'll probably be at `/players/:username`.

This is to help players find out game information about others without having to join the game. Saves time because the player doesn't have to go through in-game loading screens. 

Everything from [in-game player profiles](../general/player-profiles.md) will be available on the website.

## Searching for player profiles
There won't be a search page for player profiles; `/players` will redirect to `/`. Instead, there will be a search bar available on most pages of the website.
