## Purpose
The purpose of the soundtrack page is to give players easy access to the music and sound effects of the game. 

## Contents
The soundtrack page will have two [SoundCloud embeds](https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003568008-Embedding-a-track-or-playlist-): one for the music, and one for the sound effects. The soundtrack page should also link to an album on YouTube and Bandcamp.

There should be a message at the bottom that tells the user that they can listen to the music or use it in non-commercial projects as long as they give appropriate credit to Beastslash and the artist. For commercial projects that they expect to make money from, they should contact licensing@beastslash.com.
