# Stage Maker
When entering the Stage Maker, the player must be notified that they will give an irrevocable license to Beastslash that allows the company to use the stage for free. This will prevent players from sending DMCA takedown requests for their stages. 

## Collaborating
After the stage owner saves their stage for the first time, they may add collaborators to help them. 

### Credits
Before every match, the player will get a good view of the stage. While this happens, the stage owner's name will appear by default; however, anyone with Manager access can change the name shown. This can be helpful if the stage was created by a named team or a group of folks. Credits should not determined by access levels.

### Managing collaborators
The stage owner and anyone with Manager access can manage the collaborator list by pressing a specific button in the top bar.
