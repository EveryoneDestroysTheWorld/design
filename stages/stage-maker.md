# Stage Maker
When entering the Stage Maker, the player must be notified that they will give an irrevocable license to Beastslash that allows the company to use the stage for free. This will prevent players from sending DMCA takedown requests for their stages. 

## Publishing
### Access
After the stage owner saves the stage for the first time, they may choose to publish their stage. Collaborators with admin access to the stage can publish it. 

### Jury
#### Selection
After the stage owner publishes the stage, a jury will review it. Players who have at least played ten matches may become jurors. Stage collaborators cannot be jury members. Beastslash community staff will have the option to override the jury.

#### Review and voting
After the jurors finish reviewing, they may vote on whether the stage should be played by people outside of the jury. After a stage gets ten votes, the game will determine what to do next.

      <td>The stage will remain on the review center until it meets another criteria.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Less than 50%</td>
      <td>The stage is rejected and will be removed from the review center.</td>
    </tr>

### Unpublishing
The stage owner may unpublish their stage at any time. Replays will be unavailable unless the stage owner publishes their stage again.

If a stage owner wants to publish their stage again, they can skip the jury as long as they have not made any changes to their stage. If the stage owner has made changes and publishes their stage, they will have to go through the jury process again. Furthermore, all replays related to the stage will be deleted upon stage approval.
