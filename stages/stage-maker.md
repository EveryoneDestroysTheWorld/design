# Stage Maker
When entering the Stage Maker, the player must be notified that they will give an irrevocable license to Beastslash that allows the company to use the stage for free. This will prevent players from sending DMCA takedown requests for their stages. 

## Testing
All collaborators may test a stage from the arena without jury or Beastslash approval. Only collaborators with the Editor permission or higher may test a stage from the Stage Maker.

Testers may test stages alone, with bots, or with other players. They may also change the round settings to how they see fit. The testers may leave the round at any time without a penalty.
