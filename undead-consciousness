Undead Consciousness

* Having this ability equipped and dying while downed during the round, you'll be automatically revived in undead mode. In this mode, you'll walk at a slow speed, but you can deal 20 damage in contact with one of your enemies. You're also immune to taking any type of damage. However, while in this mode, you're still disqualified during the round and the round ends if no one else remains alive in your team.
* You can be unfortunate enough that no one would save you while downed, but with undead yourself, you can hunt down your enemies for vengeance!
* This item can be obtained by buying it in the shop... or same, but make it an exclusive Halloween ability!
